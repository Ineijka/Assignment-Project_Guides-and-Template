> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
It was an interesting experience, the instructions were clear and concise and it helped me go through the tasks with ease. At every step I was curious to see if I could find more test cases. I realised that for any given page the posibilities were huge. Even a simple page as the login form could have so many test cases.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
I started with the suggested tests, as I was testing the cases I would note down other possible tests, then I would write the test cases down and return to the page to test it. 

The process is not very intuitive, since I am not familiar with the app I am sure there were other tests that could be performed, but could only rely on the information I had at the time.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 I enjoy using the Gherking syntax with creating test cases. It is better suited for behaviour-Driven development, I think for this use cases it would've worked well too, since we were testing the webapp from a user perspective.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
I used Visual Studio, I am not familiar with any others, and so far I did not feel the need to adopt a different IDE.
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
I closely watch the video and read the instructions, I did not encounter any issues, the platform was intuitive, and instructions easy to read

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
I haven't used Github before and it's always intimidating to use another platform. I did not have any troubles using it, but aside from the basics do not fully understand all its capabilities
    
## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 
Robot Framework was easy to use and write, but in my line of work I need to use a BDD framework, so the way I am thinking about test cases is usually structured in this way. Although I do not perform tests, I often need to write them, again from a behaviour-driven perspective, so the gherkin syntax works better for me.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

ISTQB Certified
Experience in Manual and Tool Driven Testing
Experience with the SDLC
Excellent communication and collaboration skills
Experience with Cypress
Proficiency in integrating automation tests with CI/CD pipelines preferably GitLab


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
I would need better experience with testing management tools, as well as learn to automate scripts. 


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

I generally enjoy putting theoretical knowledge in practice. As a product manager this course helped me better understand my testers, how the structure their tests, what tests are needed depending on the development work completed. Although this is only 1 stage in the development cycle it is by all means a very complex one. 

It helped me understand why the testers need to be involved early in the project and the importance of working as a team instead of silos and the impact early testing can have on a project. 

I can also better understand technical concepts when described by the testers. Although I am not looking at a career in testing, it is invaluable to understand the basic concepts to aid communication and collaboration. 

I would've loved to have an optional exercise where we could ideantify a real bug rather than work on theoretical one.
